title: "Transonic Flight Optimization with IGP Parameterization for Supercritical Airfoils and Shock Control Bump"
excerpt: "This project focuses on optimizing the NACA 4412 airfoil for transonic flight at Mach 0.87 and an angle of attack of 1.5Â°, with the goal of maximizing its lift-to-drag ratio. By improving the airfoil's geometry, it aims to enhance the efficiency of the aircraft wing, reducing drag while maintaining lift in transonic conditions. The study seeks to address the challenges posed by the interaction of subsonic and supersonic flows around the airfoil.. <br/><img src='/images/portfolio/foil_optimization.png' style='display: block; margin-top: 20px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 70%; height: auto;'>"
