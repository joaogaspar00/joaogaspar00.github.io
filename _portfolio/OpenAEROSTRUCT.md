title: "Optimization and Structural Analysis Using OpenMDAO and OpenAeroStruct"
excerpt: "This study explores optimization techniques using OpenMDAO and OpenAeroStruct, starting with the minimization of the Rosenbrock Function to analyze optimization methods and gradient calculations. A detailed investigation of OpenAeroStructâ€™s structural model follows, leading to an aerodynamic optimization of an isolated wing, considering design variables such as angle of attack, twist, and chord. The effects of an additional aerodynamic constraint on the optimal solution are also analyzed. <br/><img src='/images/portfolio/openaerostruct.pdf' style='display: block; margin-top: 20px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 70%; height: auto;'>"
