title: "Sustainable Approach in LRMs: Fuel and Manufacturing    "
excerpt: "This project compares five configurations of propellants and tank materials based on performance, environmental impact, and cost. The analysis includes RP-1/LOX, LH2/LOX, and UDMH/NTO, with tanks made of aluminum or carbon fiber. Results indicate that carbon fiber is not a viable option due to cost and environmental concerns. RP-1 proved to be the most cost-effective propellant, while LH2 had the lowest environmental impact according to a Life Cycle Assessment. <br/><img src='/images/portfolio/LCA combustiveis.jpg' style='display: block; margin-top: 20px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 70%; height: auto;'>"
