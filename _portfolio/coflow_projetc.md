title: "Study of Coflow Airfoils in Star CCM+"
excerpt: "This project investigates the aerodynamic performance of a Co-Flow Jet (CFJ) airfoil using numerical simulations in STAR-CCM+. The CFJ technique, which combines suction and blowing jets along the airfoil surface, is analyzed for its ability to delay flow separation, enhance lift, and reduce drag compared to a baseline airfoil. Simulations are conducted at varying angles of attack and mass flow rates to assess the efficiency of CFJ technology in improving aerodynamic performance. <br/><img src='/images/portfolio/coflow.jpeg' style='display: block; margin-top: 20px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 70%; height: auto;'>"
